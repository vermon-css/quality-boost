# Description
Usually, when we throw a grenade, the server logic releases it after 0.1 seconds. And since the grenade inherits the playerâ€™s speed, to achieve maximum vertical speed we must jump at the same moment, since later the gravity would come in, and the vertical speed would decrease.

This macro automatically throws a flashbang and jumps after a specified amount of time. By default, the maximum vertical speed is expected.

It is implemented as [client plugin](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Client_plugins) so it can be quite convenient to use it.

# Setup
1. Place ``macro.dll`` inside ``cstrike`` folder.  
2. You should add ``--insecure`` lauch option in order to load it since the engine expects this.  
3. Enter ``plugin_load macro`` in the console being in the main menu. You may also add ``+plugin_load macro`` to the game launch parameters to automatically load it on startup.

# Usage
Activate by pressing MOUSE2 button (+attack2).  
To change the delay, there is ``macro`` console command, type ``macro {delay}``, e.g. *macro 0.08*.
